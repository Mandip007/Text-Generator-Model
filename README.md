# Text-Generator-Model 

In text generation model, the model is fed with many training examples so it can learn a pattern between the input and output. Each input is a sequence of characters and the output is the next single character. 
This model uses Recurrent Neural Networks, specifically a Long Short-Term Memory Network, implement this network in Python and use it to generate some text.

Major Python libraries like TensorFlow and Keras are used along with Numpy, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit).

The dataset used here is extracted from Project Gutenburg/berg and the file name is "frankenstein-2.txt".
